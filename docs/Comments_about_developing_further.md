Here are a few ideas that I feel are relevant to deciding whether to develop the Handshake idea further for use in helping with contact tracing.

### Privacy

- **People have the choice of whether or not to scan** their QR code or be scanned, so if they would like a particular meeting of visit to a location not to be recorded they can just choose not to Handshake.

### Getting widespread use

- Since you can **Handshake with just a web browser**, there are few barriers to adoption as their is no need to download an app. *(If QR reading is not working users could simply message a connection link to the person they are physically meeting with - though this does increase the risk of fake connections.)*
- Handshake **could be a gateway to other contact tracing tools** that are integrated with it. The Handshake web browser link could (as well as recording the connection) prompt users to download an app that uses Bluetooth or location data etc. - ideally this app would be integrated with Handshake, merging all the data.

### Quality check of other methods

- In a system where multiple approaches are integrated, **Handshake connection data can be compared with location and Bluetooth data etc.** If we suppose that almost all Handshake connections are real then we can check whether other methods did actually pick up those connections **to get an idea of how accurate other tracking methods are**.

### Relatively easy to implement

- **A QR code scanning system is relatively easy to implement**, and should be relatively easy to integrate with any other approach.

These comments are about the Handshake idea generally, not about my specific prototype. The idea is: *When people meet, one person scans the QR code of the other, registering the connection. (Plus having QR codes at locations). People can report whether they have Covid-19 or not, matched with the connection data.*
