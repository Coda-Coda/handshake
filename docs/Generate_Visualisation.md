3. After the tutorial, or skipping it, click "Import" on the left hand panel
4. Paste in the following link under "Import Edges": https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10y7cufEh8_1pYc0X4VwJ-5uBc5ztbrQABjTVg9BF_ag/edit?usp=sharing (leave "Import nodes" blank)
5. Click "Continue"
6. Click "Save"
7. Name your graph and choose any option, then click "Save"
8. Done!

You've generated a graph with the latest data from what has been reported on the Handshake forms.

Feel free to [make a copy of the Google Sheet that helps implement this](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10y7cufEh8_1pYc0X4VwJ-5uBc5ztbrQABjTVg9BF_ag/copy).

It currently includes only the first 8 characters of the unique id, for readability. This could be changed by altering the value in the Variables sheet after [making a copy](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10y7cufEh8_1pYc0X4VwJ-5uBc5ztbrQABjTVg9BF_ag/copy).
