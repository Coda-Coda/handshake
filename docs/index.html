  <h1>Handshake idea overview</h1>
  Handshake is an idea to help with tracing of Covid-19.

  <h2>Key part of idea</h2>
  <div style="color: green;">
    When people meet, <b>one person scans the QR code of the other</b>, registering the connection. </br>
    People can report whether they have Covid-19 or not, matched with the connection data.
  </div>

  </br></br></br></br>

  That simple idea may be all you need to take this idea and make a fully-fledged version (I am not in a position to do
  so). But if you're curious about further thoughts on it, please read on.


  <h2>Finer details that could differ between Handshake implementations</h2>
  <h3>Privacy</h3>
  Here are <em>some</em> options:
  <ul>
    <li>Have a centralised server keep the data recorded private.</li>
    <li>Have the data publicly available, but manage privacy by using a hash of the user's email and a passphrase (or
      some other method).</li>
    <li>Have the system only give out data that is intentionally slightly less accurate time-wise so that
      re-identification is harder (or other fuzzing).</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Centralisation/Decentralisation</h3>
  Here are a few options:
  <ul>
    <li>Centralise the logins, making it easier to be able to offer push notifications to vulnerable people.</li>
    <li>Centralise the data, making privacy easier to handle.</li>
    <li>Decentralise the 'logins', making there be no requirement for a central authority in control of the logins.</br>
      This however makes spoofing easy and relies on trusting that people don't spoof the system.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Webpage vs App</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Make it a webpage, allowing for easy access without installation of an app.</li>
    <li>Make it an app, allowing for quicker access when people want to Handshake and other benefits.</li>
    <li>Make it both, allowing for the best of both worlds.</li>
    <li>Start with a webpage and later develop an app.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Use of free tools vs a paid server etc</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Free - The whole setup can be replicated for free by anyone.</br>
      (Works best with public datasets that could be joined together).</li>
    <li>Paid - Can't be replicated for free.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Further details</h2>
  For further details and a very basic working implementation of this idea see: <a
    href="https://github.com/Coda-Coda/handshake">https://gitlab.com/Coda-Coda/handshake</a> </br>
  The implementation makes a few of the design choices described above, but the central idea is simply to have <b>one
    person scan the QR code of the other</b> when they meet.
