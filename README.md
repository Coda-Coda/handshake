![Image of Handshake - Make contact tracing easier.](docs/large_logo_open_graph2.png)

This repository contains two separate contact tracing tool ideas.

- For the one about sending an email to people and businesses you meet with see: https://coda-coda.github.io/handshake/EEE/ or for the source code see https://github.com/Coda-Coda/handshake/tree/master/docs/EEE - EEE stands for Easy Email Exchange. This option does not involve a central or public store of interactions.



- For the one about hashing unique ids and sharing them publicly see [here](README-Old-handshake-version.md).
